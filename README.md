🚀 Just Launched: AI Vision Analyzer – A Smart Image Recognition Tool Built with Azure! 🧠📸

I’m excited to share a project I recently built: an AI-powered image analysis application developed using React (frontend) and .NET (backend), integrated with Azure Computer Vision services.

✨ What it does:

🔍 Automatically identifies places, landmarks, and scenes from uploaded images

🏷️ Displays AI-generated tags to uniquely describe the content

🌍 Pulls in related Wikipedia data for informative context

📖 Provides detailed image descriptions, even if it’s not a location

This tool is a great example of how AI and cloud computing can be combined to extract intelligent insights from visual data in real time.

📦 Tech Stack:

Frontend: React + Tailwind

Backend: .NET 7 Web API

Cloud: Azure Cognitive Services (Computer Vision API)

Bonus: Wikipedia API integration for extended information

💡 Built with a focus on real-world applications like:

Travel photo recognition

Smart galleries

Visual search engines

Educational tools

Would love to hear your thoughts or suggestions! If you’re into AI, cloud, or full-stack development — let’s connect! 🤝
